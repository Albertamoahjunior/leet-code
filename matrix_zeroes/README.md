# Solution to Set Matrix Zeroes

## Overview

This solution provides an implementation for modifying a given m x n integer matrix such that if an element is 0, the entire row and column of that element are set to 0. The solution achieves this by first identifying all zero elements and then updating the respective rows and columns.

## Problem Statement

Given an m x n integer matrix, the task is to set the entire row and column to zero if any element in the matrix is zero. The operation must be performed in place.

## Code Explanation

The provided code is implemented in C++ and follows these steps:

1. **Collect Positions of Zeroes**: 
   - Traverse the matrix and collect the positions of all elements that are zero.
   - Store these positions in a vector of pairs (`zero_positions`).

2. **Set Rows and Columns to Zero**:
   - For each position stored in `zero_positions`, set the entire row and column of that position to zero.

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void setZeroes(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        vector<pair<int, int>> zero_positions;

        // Collect positions of zeroes
        for(int i = 0; i < matrix.size(); i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < matrix[i].size(); j++) {
                if(matrix[i][j] == 0) {
                    zero_positions.push_back({i, j});
                }
            }
        }

        // Set rows and columns to zero
        for(auto& pos : zero_positions) {
            int row = pos.first;
            int col = pos.second;

            // Set entire row to zero
            for(int j = 0; j < matrix[row].size(); j++) {
                matrix[row][j] = 0;
            }

            // Set entire column to zero
            for(int i = 0; i < matrix.size(); i++) {
                matrix[i][col] = 0;
            }
        }
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - A vector of pairs `zero_positions` is initialized to store the positions of zero elements in the matrix.

2. **Collect Positions of Zeroes**:
   - Two nested loops iterate through each element of the matrix.
   - If an element is zero, its position `(i, j)` is stored in `zero_positions`.

3. **Set Rows and Columns to Zero**:
   - For each position `(row, col)` in `zero_positions`:
     - Another loop iterates through the respective row and sets all its elements to zero.
     - Another loop iterates through the respective column and sets all its elements to zero.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is \(O(m \times n)\), where \(m\) is the number of rows and \(n\) is the number of columns. This is because we iterate through the matrix twice: once to collect the positions of zero elements and once to update the rows and columns.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is \(O(k)\), where \(k\) is the number of zero elements in the matrix. This is because the vector `zero_positions` stores the positions of all zero elements.

## Usage

This solution can be used in scenarios where modifying a matrix in place is required based on specific conditions. The solution efficiently identifies and updates the required elements without needing extra space proportional to the matrix size.
