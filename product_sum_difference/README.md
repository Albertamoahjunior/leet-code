## Finding the difference between the sum and the product of the digits of a number

The code takes a number, converts it into a string so it can iterate through it.
For the length of the number, it iterates through it summing each number with a sum variable initialized with zero and multiplying it with product variable initialized to one(1).
It then finds and returns the difference.
