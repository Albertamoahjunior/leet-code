# Perform the calculation to find minimum operations required

This code solves the problem requiring the minimum number of operations required to return to the main folder.
The log list given as arguments contains directory operations performed. The code is required to comb through the list and find out.

The rules are quite simple. When there is './' you stay in the same folder, when there is '../' you return to the parent folder, when there is 'x/' there is change of 
directory into an 'x' child class.
